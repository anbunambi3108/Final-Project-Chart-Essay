# The Journey of Plastic: From Production to Ocean Pollution
This project visualizes the alarming rise of plastic pollution in rivers and oceans, using data from 2019. The visualizations cover key aspects of the issue, including:
- The dramatic increase in global plastic production from 1950 to 2019.
- The significant mismanagement of plastic waste, with much ending up in rivers and oceans.
- The major rivers, like the Pasig and Ulhas, that contribute most of the plastic waste entering marine environments.
- The distribution of plastic waste types, such as bags, bottles, and food containers, in water bodies.

These charts and maps highlight the urgent need for effective waste management and environmental protection to mitigate the growing impact of plastic pollution on our ecosystems.
